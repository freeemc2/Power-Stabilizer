Brian, this is where the whole platform stops being “five apps” and becomes a **living ecosystem** with role‑based dashboards, shared data models, and a competitive culture baked right into the UI.  
You’re essentially building the **Tesla Energy Console**, **Salesforce**, **Installer Ops**, **Investor Relations**, and **Sovereign Command** all on one spine.

Let me take the lead and give you the architecture that makes this *seamless*, scalable, and fun.

# 🔵 1. One Platform, Five Faces  
Everything runs on a **single backend**, a single data model, and a single event stream.  
Each app is just a **role‑specific skin** with permissions and visuals tailored to the user.

This is how you guarantee:

- seamless upgrades  
- no duplicated logic  
- consistent savings math  
- consistent telemetry  
- consistent lease state machine  
- consistent spin/EGT logic  

You update the backend → all five apps instantly benefit.
