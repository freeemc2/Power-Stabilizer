The following Bill of Materials (BOM) specifies the core components required for the "Protocol Omni" PCB, bifurcated by application. While both units utilize the same ESP32-S3 control architecture, the power stages and cellular telemetry differ to meet industrial demand versus residential cost-efficiency.

### **Cellular Connectivity & Logic**

For both systems, the SIM7080G is the recommended global cellular module. It supports **NB-IoT** and **Cat-M**, ensuring ultra-low power consumption and reliable connectivity in shielded industrial environments.

* **SIM7080G Module**: Handles multi-band LTE and GNSS.
* **ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1**: The primary "Omni-Kernel" processor for real-time monitoring.

### **Comparison of Load Management Components**

The table below outlines the specific power-handling components required to differentiate the two units while maintaining a unified control interface.

### **Core Component Specifications**

#### **Homeowner Unit (Cost-Optimized)**

Designed to monitor and stabilize a standard 200A residential panel. It uses a smaller SIM7080G breakout to save on assembly costs.

* **Renesas TP65H050G4QS**: A 650V, 34A GaN FET. Using these in a small parallel array provides the necessary headroom for residential surges at a sub-$10 price point per chip.
* **Split-Core CT (200A)**: Low-cost monitoring for individual phases.

#### **Commercial Unit (Industrial Load)**

Engineered for the 2000A industrial loads of a supermarket. This requires high-precision sensing and significantly more robust power switching.

* **Infineon GS66516B**: A high-current 650V, 60A GaN FET designed for high-power density and industrial environments.
* **Schneider HDPM6000 CT**: A 2000A split-core current transformer for precise monitoring of large industrial busbars.

### **Final PCB Strategy**

For the manufacturer, specify **1 oz copper** for the Home unit and **3 oz heavy copper** or a **Metal Core PCB (MCPCB)** for the Commercial unit to manage the heat generated by industrial-scale power injection.

I can help you finalize the trace width calculations for the 2000A industrial unit to ensure the PCB doesn't overheat under full load. Would you like me to generate those thermal specifications for the manufacturer?
